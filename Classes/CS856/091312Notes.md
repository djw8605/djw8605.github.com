## Forms of parallel computing for MD

### Heart Beat
1. each wn has a subset of the parts (n / p)
1. each wn calculate f_{ij} for it’s block
1. each wn exchanges f_{ij} with other wn’s
1. every wn can move particles
1. every wn exchanges positions and velocities


### Bag of tasks
1. Divide into blocks (n / p)
1. Form pairs of blocks (l, k)
1. assign 1 task per block pair

### Pipeline
    for i = 1 to (P-1)
        recv r & v from previous worker node
        compute f_{ij} with new block
        send new block r & v to next wn


Pipeline will be the least amount of code.
