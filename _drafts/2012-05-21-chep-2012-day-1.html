Today was the first day of presentations. &nbsp;We had a very good Keynote from Glen Crawford from the DOE. &nbsp;Most of it was very physics heavy, therefore 90% was over my head.<br /><br />I found the <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=584&amp;sessionId=0&amp;resId=1&amp;materialId=slides&amp;confId=149557">talk</a> by Rene Brun very interesting. &nbsp;It covered software more, therefore I understood much of it.<br /><br /><br />
