Just so I don't have to remember again, in order to seperate a header from the body of a http response, in C:<br /><pre name="code" class="Bash"><br />char* endOfHeader = strstr(buf, "\n\r\n");<br /></pre><br />Notice the \r, that is a carriage return, something that Linux/unix doesn't care much about, but is used more in Windows.  I couldn't find any websites to help with this.
