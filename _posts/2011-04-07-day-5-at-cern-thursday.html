Breakfast was Choco Puffs, Fruit, and Orange/Passion fruit juice.<br /><br />Today was largely Management meetings, so I was free to play tourist at CERN.  I went to the Reception area:<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-59Rt15FB8NQ/TZ2r76cw96I/AAAAAAAAASM/U5FGnpf6X1U/s1600/100_0203.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-59Rt15FB8NQ/TZ2r76cw96I/AAAAAAAAASM/U5FGnpf6X1U/s400/100_0203.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592815358054561698" border="0" /></a>There I bought stuff for the family.  I sure hope Tristan's shirt will fit.<br /><br />I then walked past the Dome.  I learned later that it opens at 10, I was an hour early.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KivT6F37BeI/TZ2tLa_JawI/AAAAAAAAASs/H52xesnubXY/s1600/100_0204.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KivT6F37BeI/TZ2tLa_JawI/AAAAAAAAASs/H52xesnubXY/s400/100_0204.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592816723998370562" border="0" /></a><br />Next, I walked by the ATLAS control room.  It is positioned above the ATLAS detector, which is ~100M underground.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-myLEwGSQaJQ/TZ2tem0sQFI/AAAAAAAAAS0/tfWwiGm_nck/s1600/100_0206.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-myLEwGSQaJQ/TZ2tem0sQFI/AAAAAAAAAS0/tfWwiGm_nck/s400/100_0206.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592817053593256018" border="0" /></a><br />I wish I could visit the CMS Control room, but it's located on the other side of the ring, at 0.5.<br /><br />For lunch, a few people from FNAL drove downtown to a Kabob restaurant, though no one actually had Kabobs.  Instead, we had very large pita sandwiches.  I had a beef pita with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.<br /><br />In the afternoon, I worked on a few OSG things (mostly debugging campus factory).  I met with CernVM-FS people to discuss possibly making it into a generic library that can be used by other applications (non-fuse).<br /><br />For dinner, Chris, Eric, and I walked to a restaurant towards Geneva.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oipagf79JEk/TZ6zdqnls4I/AAAAAAAAAUc/LPGx1IGoPcg/s1600/100_0208.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oipagf79JEk/TZ6zdqnls4I/AAAAAAAAAUc/LPGx1IGoPcg/s400/100_0208.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5593105109478650754" border="0" /></a><br />I had Penne with meat sauce.  Very good!<br /><br />On the trip back, I took a few pictures (didn't turn out all that well).  This is a picture of the road to CERN from our restaurant.  You can see (fuzzy) the CERN Dome.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f0M5eoLGpNQ/TZ7cc_1nMeI/AAAAAAAAAU0/FMQcMrdroVk/s1600/100_0210.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f0M5eoLGpNQ/TZ7cc_1nMeI/AAAAAAAAAU0/FMQcMrdroVk/s400/100_0210.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5593150177971483106" border="0" /></a><br />We also saw the new Tram for CERN.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4AFY7gs9bc/TZ7clJsPXjI/AAAAAAAAAU8/MGzi8Q2hT_M/s1600/100_0214.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4AFY7gs9bc/TZ7clJsPXjI/AAAAAAAAAU8/MGzi8Q2hT_M/s400/100_0214.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5593150318055480882" border="0" /></a>
