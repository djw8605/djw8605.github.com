A year or so ago, Ian Stokes-Rees showed me a job visualization that he had put together to see how his workflows where going. &nbsp;Gives a good overview per site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we where investigating usage from a NEES user, and I adapted the aging script to visualize the workflow. &nbsp;I think it turned out really well.<br /><br />Note: &nbsp;Be prepared to zoom in a lot. &nbsp;Job ID's are printed at the beginning of execution. &nbsp;Green lines are successful completions. &nbsp;Red lines are Evicted or Job Disconnected jobs.<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B_RVv_OjWcURNDRkZjEyM2QtZTIyOC00OTU1LTg0OWUtYzRkMGFiNzc1MTJk&amp;hl=en_US">View on Google Docs</a><br /><br />Very ugly source is on github:&nbsp;https://github.com/djw8605/condor_log_analyze<br /><br />It's times like this I wish I had a tile wall again.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G1K7hB5iLkM/Tfu1IWENuDI/AAAAAAAAAgE/lgzojeISlJI/s1600/cropped-tile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="371" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G1K7hB5iLkM/Tfu1IWENuDI/AAAAAAAAAgE/lgzojeISlJI/s400/cropped-tile.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Note, I found chrome's pdf viewer faster than Preview.
