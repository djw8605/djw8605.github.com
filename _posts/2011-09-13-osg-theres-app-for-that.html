So I thought this weekend would be a good time to learn something new. &nbsp;I put together an OSG Android App. &nbsp;Not all the features are working yet, but I tend to release early and often on all my projects.<br /><br />I was motivated by SuperComputing '11 coming up. &nbsp;My <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/InstallingOSGGoogleEarth">other visualization</a> is&nbsp;incrementally&nbsp;better than last year, so I wanted to bring something new. &nbsp;Everyone knows the shinier the toys at SC, the better. &nbsp;Who knows, maybe I can use an tablet and show some cool things to people walking by.<br /><br /><br />So far, the working features are:<br />- Automatically updated global usage data on the home screen<br />- Usage queried from gratia for every site and VO<br />- Graphing of the usage data (though I want to work on that some)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-beqOfLzNviY/Tm7piE8-WII/AAAAAAAAAks/WnIvmhJxsaI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-09-12+at+7.51.51+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-beqOfLzNviY/Tm7piE8-WII/AAAAAAAAAks/WnIvmhJxsaI/s320/Screen+Shot+2011-09-12+at+7.51.51+PM.png" width="192" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9mNcCZmZYxI/Tm7pkNRjoHI/AAAAAAAAAkw/4AWnlsT32Ok/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-09-12+at+7.52.14+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9mNcCZmZYxI/Tm7pkNRjoHI/AAAAAAAAAkw/4AWnlsT32Ok/s320/Screen+Shot+2011-09-12+at+7.52.14+PM.png" width="192" /></a></div><br /><br />The features I want to work on more:<br />- Get the map to show sites across the US. &nbsp;Whether it shows RSV data (boring) or usage data (slightly better), I'm not sure yet.<br />- Plot usage data as stacked line graph, consistent with current gratia plots.<br />- Get a better looking home screen. &nbsp;It seems too 'black'.<br /><br /><br />You can get it now on the Android market. &nbsp;Search for osg. &nbsp;It claims to support 2.2+. &nbsp;It works well on my 2.3.3 phone, and works in the 2.2 emulator. &nbsp;Please go and try it out.<br /><br /><a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.osg.osgmon">  <img alt="Available in Android Market" src="http://www.android.com/images/brand/60_avail_market_logo2.png" /></a><br /><br />Source is on github:&nbsp;https://github.com/djw8605/OSG-Android<br /><br />DISCLAMER: This app is unofficial.<br /><br />
