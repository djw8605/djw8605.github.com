Since September was a while ago, I'll keep this short. &nbsp;Most of Sept. was figuring out the class/work/research schedule. &nbsp;It had been a 2 years since I've taken anywhere near a full load of classes, and it's funny how quick you forget the work a class takes.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>OSG Software</b></span><br />During September, I continued to help with the OSG software effort. &nbsp;By the beginning of September, I had handed most of my tasks off to others, but I still contributed here and there. &nbsp;I especially contributed to discussions on the software that I had built, this was especially evident for the Condor build in the OSG repositories.<br /><br />For the OSG Condor build, I backported the 7.7 builds from the Fedora distribution. &nbsp;There was some discussion on the method I choose to build the Condor version was the best. &nbsp;I would argue it is the best of a bad situation. &nbsp;There is no 'proper' build of Condor for RHEL5. &nbsp;This is very much on purpose, since Redhat won't allow a EL5 build of Condor in EPEL since it's distributed in their MRG product. &nbsp;Also, the RPM's that the Condor team produce do not conform to the OSG software standards. &nbsp;They are statically linked against a lot of libraries. &nbsp;They don't have source RPMs. &nbsp;They also just recently started putting things in the right locations, /etc, /usr/bin... <br /><br />But, by backporting the Fedora build, we didn't get CREAM support. &nbsp;We never had CREAM support before in the VDT, but we would still like it, since it's in the 'binary blob' Condor builds. &nbsp;We would need a properly packaged CREAM client in order to do this.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of removing Condor from the osg-client. &nbsp;Condor has been a member of the OSG client since the very beginning. &nbsp;Condor-G is the base method for submitting globus jobs for almost all systems we use today. &nbsp;I can imagine a user downloading the osg-client, then wanting to run a job. &nbsp;But they can't, because they need to install Condor too (which is easy, but still).<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>SuperComputing Conference Prep</b></span><br />In the month of September, I started developing and forming my idea for Supercomputing visualization. &nbsp;If you don't know, I LOVE visualizations. &nbsp;Especially when it explains a very complex system in an understandable way. &nbsp;Self promotion: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/djw8605">Youtube channel</a> <br /><br />The first task for SuperComputing was to add GLOW usage to the <a href="http://derekweitzel.blogspot.com/2011/10/sc11-visualization-prep.html">google earth display</a>. &nbsp;While I was at it, I added documentation on how to install and run the OSG google earth display on the <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/InstallingOSGGoogleEarth">twiki</a>.<br /><br />There where no great ideas on how to expand the current google earth display. &nbsp;We could add transfers, but we don't have good transfer accounting on a per-VO level. &nbsp;Plus, not many VO's do file transfers outside of CMS and ATLAS. &nbsp;Another idea was to incorporate globus online traffic. &nbsp;But again, I don't think the number of transfers, especially to and from OSG sites, is high enough to show that traffic. &nbsp;Maybe one day it will...<br /><br />So, I turned to something that I had wanted to learn for a while, Android. &nbsp;In the course of a weekend, I built an&nbsp;<a href="http://derekweitzel.blogspot.com/2011/09/osg-theres-app-for-that.html">OSG Android App</a>. &nbsp;After demonstrating the app at HCC for a week, I was able to purchase a Android tablet that will be interactively displayed at SuperComputing. &nbsp;The goal of the application is to provide interactive status of the OSG. &nbsp;Either at the site level, or by VO.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>Campus Grids</b></span><br />We got Bill from VT running through the Engage submit host. &nbsp;He is flocking to the Engage submit host, and then out to the OSG, all while using whole machine slots. &nbsp;Additionally, he's flocking to campus factories that are also running whole machine jobs. &nbsp;He was very quick to get it setup, and then start running actual science through the system. &nbsp;His usage is currently monitored by <a href="http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/xml/glidein_hours_bar_smry?probe=condor:dhcpseven237.bioinformatics.vt.edu">gratia</a>. &nbsp;He hasn't been real active lately, you may need to expand the start and end dates. &nbsp;We should thank the Renci admins Brad and Jonathan for their with the setup, they have been super fast learners of the glideinwms system. &nbsp;And, maybe more importantly, willing to experiment!<br /><br />There where a few issues this month with Gratia collection. &nbsp;It mostly boils down to mis-understandings on what we are accounting, what is possible (practical) to account (not the same as what we are accounting), and what counts as an 'OSG job'. <br /><br />We enabled Florida running with the campus factory. &nbsp;They had it setup before, but something had changed and caused some held jobs. &nbsp;It turned out to be harmless, but still a sign of how multiple layers can complicate the system. &nbsp;At least the users only see 1, Condor.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>Cloud Platform</b></span><br />When I got back after spending the summer at FNAL, there where a few changes at HCC. &nbsp;First, we had a 'cloud' platform that was just starting to take shape. &nbsp;HCC built a Openstack prototype on a few nodes. &nbsp;I helped beta test the cloud, figuring out a few bugs. &nbsp;I'm happy to report that it is now 'just working'. &nbsp;It has been especially useful when I want to try out new software quickly. &nbsp;For example, last week I quickly <a href="http://derekweitzel.blogspot.com/2011/10/ceph-on-fedora-15.html">installed CEPH</a> distributed file system, and found it usable. &nbsp;It also has been very useful for quick install tests of OSG software.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><b>Misc.</b></span><br />Started using the GOC factory. &nbsp;Very happy to have some fault tolerance on our GlideinWMS install. &nbsp;Though in practice, UCSD has been very stable, it's a nice piece of mind.<br /><br />New user on our glideinwms machine. &nbsp;Monica from Brown university running some Neutrino experiments (I'm not a physicist!) . &nbsp;For now she's running as HCC, but that may change in the future if usage increases.<br /><br />Various Grid administration of the HCC site. &nbsp;I've been transitioning off of administrating most of the HCC resources that I used to maintain, freeing me for class work mostly.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
