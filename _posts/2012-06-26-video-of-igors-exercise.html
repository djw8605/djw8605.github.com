Igor had a very interesting <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/OSGSS2012TueIntSec">exercise</a> during the <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/OSGUserSchool2012">OSG Summer School</a>. <br /><br />It's a little difficult to explain, but:<br />Each student at the tables is a worker node. &nbsp;The people walking around are the 'network', sending jobs to the scheduler which is near the podium. &nbsp;The students in the stands are 'users'. <br /><br />The worker nodes can report wrong results, and also mis-represent themselves. &nbsp;This is a security exercise.<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dbcCRweC8JM" width="560"></iframe>
