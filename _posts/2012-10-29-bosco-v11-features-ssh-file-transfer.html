I am hoping to write about a few of the new features of BOSCO 1.1 before it comes out in December or January. &nbsp;This is part 1 of that series:<br /><br /><h3>BOSCO v1.1 Feature: SSH File Transfer</h3><div><b>What is it?</b></div><div>SSH File Transfer feature improves the method of staging input and output files to the remote cluster. &nbsp;In 1.0, files are transferred by starting a daemon on the remote cluster that connects back to the submit host over a random port. &nbsp;This required a lot of open ports on the submit host. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The new SSH File Transfer will limit the number of ports required on the submit host. &nbsp;BOSCO will now transfer files over a port that is forwarded over the SSH connection that BOSCO maintains with the remote cluster. &nbsp;The transfers are&nbsp;inherently&nbsp;secure as they are over the SSH connection, as well as they are authenticated by the Condor daemons on either end of the connection (remote cluster and submit host). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This fits into the BOSCO team's goal of lowering the amount of ports used by Condor. &nbsp;Our eventual goal is using the Shared Port Daemon to limit the required ports to 1 for BOSCO on the submit host.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Why should I care?</b></div><div>This will greatly reduce the number of ports required if you are only using the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">universe=grid</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;method of submitting jobs. &nbsp;In fact, it will reduce the open ports on the submit host to 0. &nbsp;That means no more configuring firewalls for BOSCO (no campus factory support, see below). &nbsp;Additionally, there is no new configuration required for this feature, it 'just works' (famous last words?)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Campus Factory, which adds features such as fault tolerant Condor file transfer and transparent multi-cluster support, still requires multiple open ports in the firewall. &nbsp;Additional effort will be required to change the Campus Factory configuration and daemons to support the single port. &nbsp;I hope that a single port will be all that is needed for v1.2. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><h3><span style="font-family: inherit;">What's Next</span></h3><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Over the next couple weeks, I hope to write more about upcoming features such as:</span></div><div><ul><li>Multi-Platform support (ie cluster and submit host are different platforms)</li><li>Mac OSX Support</li><li>Improved Multi-User support</li></ul></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
