This is part 3 of my ongoing series describing new features in BOSCO v1.1. &nbsp;Part 1 covered <a href="http://derekweitzel.blogspot.com/2012/10/bosco-v11-features-ssh-file-transfer.html">file transfer over SSH</a>, Part 2 covered <a href="http://derekweitzel.blogspot.com/2012/11/bosco-v11-features-single-port-usage.html">single port usage</a>. &nbsp;This post will cover the Multi-OS Support in BOSCO.<br /><br /><h3>What is it?</h3><div>The Multi-OS feature is intended to allow users to submit to clusters that may not be the same operating system as the submit host. &nbsp;This is especially useful when users are running a submit host on their personal computer that is running Debian, while the supercomputer in the next building is running Red Hat 6, a common&nbsp;occurrence.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Multi-OS components follow a basic process in order to operate:</div><div><ol><li>Detect the remote operating system with the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">findplatform</span> script.</li><li>Download (from the cloud?) the appropriate bosco version for the platform.</li><li>Transfer the files needed on the remote cluster. &nbsp;This includes grabbing the libraries and binaries for the campus factory's glideins. &nbsp;The glidein creation takes the most time of this process as it needs to compress the libraries and binaries before transferring.</li><li>When BOSCO detects jobs idle on the submit host, it will start glideins appropriate for the platform to service the jobs.</li></ol><div>The Multi-OS support required modification of the cluster addition and adding both a <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">findplatform</span> script and a <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">glidein_creation</span> script. &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><h3>Why do I care?</h3><div>It is becoming increasingly common that what users run on their machines and what is run on supercomputers are different. &nbsp;When this is true, it is difficult to install software from one onto the other. &nbsp;The Multi-OS feature will greatly simplify the installation of BOSCO on clusters.</div><div><br /></div><div>Our goal with the Multi-OS support is that the users may not know it is even working. &nbsp;The users just say: "I want to run on this cluster", and BOSCO makes it happen. &nbsp;No matter what operating system is running on the remote cluster.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of my tests simulated a possible user&nbsp;scenario&nbsp; &nbsp;I was running a updated RHEL 6 machine which I installed BOSCO. &nbsp;I wanted to submit jobs to a RHEL 5 cluster located in our datacenter. &nbsp;If I simply copied over the bosco install from the RHEL 6 submit host, none of the binaries would work. &nbsp;But instead, I used the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">bosco_cluster -a</span> to add the RHEL 5 cluster, and jobs ran seamlessly from the RHEL 6 machine to the RHEL 5. &nbsp;</div><br />The Multi-OS support is available in the latest alphas available on the bosco&nbsp;<a href="http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/">download</a>&nbsp;page.<br /><br />
