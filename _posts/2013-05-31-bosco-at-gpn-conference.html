<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dce.k-state.edu/conf/great-plains-network/"><img border="0" height="144" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BFCpTN4PKUk/Uai05jeJDLI/AAAAAAAAB8U/FWeK3VaXohw/s640/5882-Great_Plains_Banner.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />This week, I presented the Bosco poster at the Great Plains Network annual meeting. &nbsp;It received a very good reception. &nbsp;Many people where interested in what Bosco could do for them. &nbsp;Most of the audience was HPC center admins or directors, therefore they where looking at how they can use Bosco to help their users utilize their campus clusters.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--vTBe5pJ8nY/Uai1vSe1PJI/AAAAAAAAB8g/_bi_Pr22aEY/s1600/derek-bosco-gpn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--vTBe5pJ8nY/Uai1vSe1PJI/AAAAAAAAB8g/_bi_Pr22aEY/s400/derek-bosco-gpn.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">At the poser presentation</td></tr></tbody></table>At the conference we heard a lot about networks, as GPN is mostly a network collaboration. &nbsp;But we also heard about the <a href="http://condo-of-condos.org/">Condo of Condos</a>&nbsp;proposal which the OSG is well represented (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miron_Livny">Miron</a>). &nbsp;There is a very good webcast of the description of Condo of Condos on the <a href="http://events.internet2.edu/2013/annual-meeting/program.cfm?go=session&amp;id=10002997&amp;event=1262">I2 Website</a>. &nbsp;It feels like it's very early in the planning phase, but I am curious how the OSG will integrate with the Condos.<br /><br />The weather has been terrible, but the meeting has been great.<br /><br /><br />
