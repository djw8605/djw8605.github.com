A lot has happened since I last posted in January.<br /><br /><ol><li>I have successfully defended and submitted my dissertation:&nbsp;<i><a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/computerscidiss/88/">Enabling Distributed Scientific Computing on the Campus</a></i>. &nbsp;I will formally graduate on August 15.</li><li>I have been offered, and accepted, a position with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln Holland Computing Center. &nbsp;I will be working with the Open Science Grid's software &amp; investigations team.</li><li>On a personal note, I am now engaged.</li><li>And I am moving later this year to the HCC Omaha office.</li></ol>Now that I have graduated, I hope to write more blog posts about what I am doing, as well as what is happening in the OSG teams that I am working with.<br /><br />
